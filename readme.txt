This is my very first website. This website's purpose is to be a webpage that allows users to create checklists and blog posts.
Some of the things I've learned:
MongoDB
AJAX Calls
HTTP Requests
RESTful 
CRUD (Create, Render, Update, Delete)
Express & its middleware
Headers(ish)
Semantic UI
jQuery
Promises
Callbacks
Error Handling (ish)
Request/Response Format (eg. err is always the first parameter of a function)
